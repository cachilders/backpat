# Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Please ensure your bug description is clear
and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

The absolute best way to report a bug is to submit a pull request including a
new failing test which describes the bug. When the bug is fixed, your pull
request can then be merged!

The next best way to report a bug is to provide a reduced test case on jsFiddle
or jsBin or produce exact code inline in the issue which will reproduce the bug.
